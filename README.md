</p>

<p>
6. Click the ticket that you think that has the highest impact on business, in my case it is the <ins>Entire mobile banking is down</ins> since it has the potential to make our business lose money.
</p>

<p>

<p>

</p>

- Let's pretend that I'm a System Administrator, I'll change <ins>Assigned to</ins> my name and click <ins>Assign</ins>.

<p>

</p>

- Change the <ins>SLA Plan</ins> to Sev-A since it is affecting the business and we need to fix it ASAP. Click <ins>Update</ins> once finished.

<p>

</p>

- Change the <ins>Department</ins> to System Administrators since System Admins are more experienced or Support are not allowed to fix this kind of issue. Click <ins>Transfer</ins> once finished.

<p>
